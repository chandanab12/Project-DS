### Outline

 As of now, Tweeter does not seem to support a WebSocket API. 
 As part I of this project, you need to build an engine that (in part II) will be paired up with WebSockets to provide full functionality. Specific things we have to do are: 

Implement a Twitter-like engine with the following functionality:
Register account
Send tweet. Tweets can have hashtags (e.g. #COP5615isgreat) and mentions (@bestuser)
Subscribe to user's tweets
Re-tweets (so that your subscribers get an interesting tweet you got by other means)
Allow querying tweets subscribed to, tweets with specific hashtags, tweets in which the user is mentioned (my mentions)
If the user is connected, deliver the above types of tweets live (without querying)

 &nbsp;
 
Implement a tester/simulator to test the above
Simulate as many users as you can
Simulate periods of live connection and disconnection for users
Simulate a Zipf distribution on the number of subscribers. For accounts with a lot of subscribers, increase the number of tweets. Make some of these messages re-tweets

 &nbsp;

Other considerations:
The client part (send/receive tweets) and the engine (distribute tweets) have to be in separate processes. Preferably, you use multiple independent client processes that simulate thousands of clients and a single-engine process
You need to measure various aspects of your simulator and report performance
