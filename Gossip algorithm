## Outline
The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of such algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in Erlang. 
&nbsp;

The topologies implemented in this project include:

Full Network: Every actor is a neighbor of all other actors. That is, every actor can talk directly to any other actor.
2D Grid: Actors form a 2D grid. The actors can only talk to the grid neighbors
Line: Actors are arranged in a line. Each actor has only 2 neighbors (one left and one right, unless you are the first or last actor).
Imperfect 3D Grid: Grid arrangement but one random other neighbor is selected from the list of all actors (8+1 neighbors).

The algorithms implemented in this project are as follows:
-Gossip Algorithm: Convergence of Gossip algorithm for all topologies assuming atleast 10 nodes have heard the rumour.
- Push-sum:  The nodes are converged when the ratio does not change more than 10^-10 in three consecutive rounds. 

## Instructions to run
The program takes inputs in command line as follows:
Run all the .erl files
main:start(No. of nodes, Name of the topology, Name of the algorithm)
